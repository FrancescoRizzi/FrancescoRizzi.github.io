# FrancescoRizzi.github.io

My personal GitHub site.

You should actually view this via its proper URL: https://FrancescoRizzi.github.io
That should display the index (main) page.

If you're reading this document, you're probably looking at the repository behind that page, and its *README.md* file.

If you need to run a copy of this repository, you need it to be served through a web server (eg: Apache, IIS, or even as simple as `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`), as the `file://`` protocol is not supported (sorry).
